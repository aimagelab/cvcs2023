# The "|" character introduces a 'block literal', which means all text indented below

    # Final project submission

    ### Instructions
    - After completing the session, remember to click on **the green tick box** in the upper-right to submit the
      overall flow. Otherwise, it will be considered in a draft state.
    - Before taking the exam, **you can always submit a new version** of your project, even if you already completed a session.
    - The project version which will be used to compute your mark will be the last version uploaded before any member of the group takes the exam.

        From here, you can upload the code of your project. This should be a single ZIP file.

        - The source code should clearly indicate how to reproduce the proposed pipeline, and where
        the required outputs are computed.
        - Additionally, any external resource required to execute the code, apart from the dataset
        and freely available libraries, should be included in the package.
        - If external packages are used, you are kindly invited to provide either a readme file
        or a requirements.txt file.
