    ### Instructions
    - After completing an exercise, click on "**Submit answer for feedback**" to have your code corrected. Clicking
      "Save answer" will just save the answer in a draft state.
    - After completing the session, remember to click on **the green tick box** in the upper-right to submit the
      overall test. Otherwise, the full test will be considered in a draft state.

                # 3D Convolution
                Your code will take an input tensor `input`
                with shape `(n, iC, T, H, W)`, a kernel `kernel`
                with shape `(oC, iC, kT, kH, kW)` and a bias `bias` with shape
                `(oC, )`.

                It needs then to apply
                a 3D convolution over `input`, using `kernel` as kernel tensor and `bias` as bias,
                using a stride of 1, no dilation, no grouping, and no padding,
                and store the result in `out`.

                `input`, `kernel` and `bias` are `torch.Tensor` with `dtype` `torch.float32`.

                # 3D Max Pooling
                Your code will take as input:

                - a tensor `input` with shape `(n, iC, T, H, W)`;
                - a kernel temporal span `kT`, height `kH` and width `kW`;
                - a stride `s`;

                It needs then to apply
                a 3D max-pooling over `input`, using the given kernel size and
                the same stride `s` on all axes, and store the result in `out`.
                Input `input` has dtype `torch.float32`. `s` is an integer.
