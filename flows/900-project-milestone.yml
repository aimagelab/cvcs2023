        - Problem statement: Describe your problem precisely specifying the dataset to be used, expected results and evaluation
        - Technical Approach: Describe the methods you intend to apply to solve the given problem
        - Intermediate/Preliminary Results: State and evaluate your results upto the milestone

        A [sample (non mandatory) template](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/files/cvpr2019AuthorKit.zip) is available.
